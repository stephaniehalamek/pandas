    "\n",
    "The one thing you need for data analysis is **data**. If you do not have any data, then you won't be able to use pandas to analyze it. This book contains many data sets stored externally in the `data` directory one level above where this notebook resides. Most of these datasets are stored as comma-separated value (**CSV**) files. These CSVs are human-readable and separate each individual piece of data with a comma. The comma is referred to as the **delimiter**. Despite its name, CSVs can use other one-character delimiters besides commas such as tabs, semi-colons, or others. \n",

    "We begin our data analysis adventure with a dataset on public bike rides from the city of Chicago. The data is contained in the `bikes.csv` file. There are about 50,000 recorded rides from 2013 through 2017. Each row of the dataset represents a single ride from a single person using the city's public bike stations. There are 19 columns of data containing information on gender, start time, trip duration, bike station name, temperature, wind speed, and more. Let's print out the first three lines of the `bikes.csv` file using Python's built-in capabilities for reading files. This does not use pandas. Take note of the commas separating each value on each line."

These terms will be used throughout the book and understanding them is vital to your ability to use pandas. Take a look at the following graphic of our `bikes` DataFrame stylized to put emphasis on each component.\n",

    "\n",
    "### The columns\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns provide a **label** for each column and are always displayed in **bold** font above the data. A column is a single vertical sequence of data. In the above DataFrame, the column name `tripduration` references all the values in that column (993, 623, 1040, etc...).\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns are also referred to as the **column names** or the **column labels** with individual values referred to as a **column name** or **column label**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most DataFrames, like the one above, use strings for column names, but it is possible that they can be other types such as integers. The column names are not required to be unique, though having duplicate columns would be bad practice, as it's vital to be able to uniquely identify each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The index\n",
    "\n",
    "The index provides a **label** for each row and is always displayed to the left of the data. A row is a single horizontal sequence of data. For instance, the index label **3** references all the values in its row (12907, Subscriber, Male, etc...)\n",
    "\n",
    "The index is also referred to as the **index names/labels** or the **row names/labels** with the individual values referred to as a(n) **index name/label** or **row name/label**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above DataFrame, the index is simply a sequence of integers beginning at 0. The values in the index are not limited to integers. Strings are a common type that are used in the index and make for more descriptive labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surprisingly, values in the index are not required to be unique. In fact, all of the index values can be the same. A row label does not guarantee a one-to-one mapping to one specific row.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The data\n",

    "The actual data is to the right of the index and below the columns and is displayed with normal font. The data is also referred to as the **values**.
