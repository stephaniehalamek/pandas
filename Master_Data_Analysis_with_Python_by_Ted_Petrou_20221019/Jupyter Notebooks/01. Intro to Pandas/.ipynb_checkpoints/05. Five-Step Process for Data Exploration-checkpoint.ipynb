    "# Five-Step Process for Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we discuss a simple process for exploring data in a Jupyter Notebook. This is the same process that I use when exploring data for the first time and should help you understand data better and write better, cleaner code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Major issues arise for beginners when too many lines of code are written in a single cell of a notebook. It's important to get feedback on every single line of code that you write and verify that it is, in fact, correct. Only once you have verified the result should you move on to the next line of code. To help increase your ability to do data exploration in Jupyter Notebooks, I recommend the following five-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write and execute a single line of code to explore your data\n",
    "1. Verify that this line of code works by inspecting the output\n",
    "1. Assign the result to a variable\n",
    "1. Within the same cell, in a second line, output the head of the DataFrame or Series\n",
    "1. Continue to the next cell. Do not add more lines of code to the cell\n",
    "\n",
    "### Apply to every part of the analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "You can apply this five-step process to every part of your data analysis. Let's begin by reading in the movie dataset and applying the five-step process for setting the index of our DataFrame as the `title` column."

    "It is tempting to do more analysis in a single cell. I advise against doing so when you are a beginner. By limiting your analysis to a single main line of code per cell, and outputting that result, you can easily trace your work from one step to the next. Most lines of code in a notebook apply some operation to the data. It is vital that you can see exactly what this operation is doing. If you put multiple lines of code in a single cell, you lose track of what is happening and can't easily determine the veracity of each operation.\n",

    "### When to assign the result to a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all operations on our data need to be assigned to a variable. We might just be interested in seeing the results. But, for many operations, you will want to continue with the new transformed data. By assigning the result to a variable, you will have immediate access to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to create a new variable name\n",
    "\n",
    "During step 3 of the first example, the result of our new dataset was assigned to `movie2`. We could have reassigned the result back to `movie` and continued on with our analysis. When first exploring data, I recommend creating a new variable name for each major result. By doing so, you have preserved each step of your work and are able to inspect it at a later date. Creating new variables makes it much easier to find errors at different places in your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to reuse variable names\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside to using new variable names is that each variable can hold a copy of the data and if your dataset is large, you might take up unnecessary amounts of memory slowing down the performance of your machine. By reassigning a result to the same variable name, you'll reduce memory used. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another time to reuse variable names is when you are confident that the analysis you have produced is correct and no longer needed to preserve all the previous results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuously verifying results\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of how adept you become at doing data explorations, it is good practice to verify each line of code. Data science is difficult and it is easy to make mistakes. Data is also messy and it is good to be skeptical while proceeding through an analysis. Getting visual verification that each line of code produces the desired result is important. Doing this provides feedback to help you think about what avenues to explore next."
