    "# Numeric Series Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main accomplishment up to this point has been selecting subsets of data. We have not changed the data or produced any interesting calculations. In this chapter, we begin our journey calling Series methods containing numeric data to produce a result of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calling Series methods\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already called some methods such as the `head`, `tail`, `isna`, and `set_index`. This chapter covers many more methods that work on numeric Series such as `min`, `max`, `mean`, and `median`. A numeric series is one that contains integers or floats. Many of these methods will work on data of other types, but will always work for numeric Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimally sufficient pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "There are over 200 methods available to both the Series and DataFrame.  It can be overwhelming to think about having to learn and memorize this staggering amount of functionality. The good news is that many of these methods are unnecessary and don't add any extra functionality. Furthermore, many methods are remnants from the early days of pandas and have few/no use cases or have been **deprecated**. When a method is deprecated, then it is both discouraged from being used and will likely be removed from the library in the future. For example, the `ix` indexer was useful in the earlier days of pandas to simultaneously select rows and columns of data. It was deprecated in favor of the `loc` and `iloc` indexers and removed in pandas version 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "I suggest using a subset of the pandas library that allows you to do as many tasks as possible. I focus on the subset of pandas that maximizes both performance and readability. Since there is so much functionality, power users of pandas can think of very creative and complex code to accomplish different tasks. This is not necessarily a positive thing, and when working with a group of other data analysts can lead to confusion for those that are not familiar with the syntax. One of my most popular blog posts is titled [Minimally Sufficient Pandas][1] and goes into greater detail on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin our exploration of attributes and methods with Series objects. It is far simpler to focus on a single column of data than multiple columns in a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "### View the API for a complete list of functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern programming languages use the term **Application Programming Interface** or **API** to list and describe all the possible functionality therein. The pandas API reference can be [found here][2]. This is a huge list, but as mentioned above, only a subset of this page is needed for the vast majority of tasks. You may find it useful to navigate to the [Series API][3] section of the documentation so that you can have a full list of its functionality for this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## City of Houston Employee Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a public dataset containing City of Houston employee information on their position, race, sex, and salary. This dataset was last updated in July of 2019 and contains nearly all of the employees for the City of Houston. Notice that the column `hire_date` can be read in as a datetime.\n",
