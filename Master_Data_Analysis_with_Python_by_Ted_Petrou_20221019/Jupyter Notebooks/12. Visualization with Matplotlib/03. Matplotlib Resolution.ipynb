    "If you were to measure the actual width and height of the image produced on your screen, it is likely to be less than the given 5 inches by 2 inches. To help differentiate the inches that matplotlib uses versus the inches on a computer screen, we'll use the terms **figure-inches** and **screen-inches**. In this example, the plot has dimensions of 5 x 2 in figure-inches, and on my screen it's about 3.6 x 1.6 screen-inches.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why the figure-inches and screen-inches differ, we must understand how computer screen resolution works. Screen resolution is measured in **pixels**, the smallest component of a screen. Dimensions of a screen are reported as the number of pixels along the width and height. To get your screen resolution, navigate to [http://whatismyscreenresolution.net](http://whatismyscreenresolution.net/). Your actual resolution isn't always what's reported by the manufacturer.

To find the number of pixels in an image, multiply the figure-inches by the DPI of the matplotlib figure. Our current figure with dimensions of 5 x 2 figure-inches is 500 pixels by 200 pixels. An image with those pixel dimensions is what matplotlib displayed above."
