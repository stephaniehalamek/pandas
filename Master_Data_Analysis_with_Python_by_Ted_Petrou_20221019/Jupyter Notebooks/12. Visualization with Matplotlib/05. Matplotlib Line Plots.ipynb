    "# Matplotlib Line Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will plot actual data with matplotlib line and scatter plots. Thus far, we have yet to do any data visualization. We've focused on understanding how to create the figure and axes, and how to change its properties using the object-oriented approach. We've also covered how to add straight lines, text, and patches, and how to choose colors for them. None of these plotting objects came from data. In this chapter, we will use our data that we previously analyzed within a pandas DataFrame to make data visualizations with matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Axes API\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll continue to call methods from the axes object, but concentrate on those that plot data. It can be helpful to navigate to the [axes API page from matplotlib's official documentation][1] which contains around 300 different methods. The API page categorizes and groups each method by its functionality. In this chapter, we focus on the `plot` method from the [plotting section][2].\n",

    "\n",
    "The `plot` method's primary purpose is to create line plots. It does have the ability to create scatter plots as well, but that task is best reserved for the `scatter` method. A more appropriate name for this method would have been `lineplot` as the name `plot` isn't descriptive. You'll have to make the association that `plot` really means line plot. All of the other plotting methods are descriptive of what kind of plot they actually create except this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `plot` method is very flexible and can take a variety of different inputs. Instead of covering all of the possible ways to use the `plot` method, a single, straightforward approach will be given. The first two arguments to the `plot` method are the x and y coordinates of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, a numpy array of the integers from -5 to 5 is created with the `arange` function. These values represent the  coordinates of our line. The squared values of this array are used as the y coordinates.  We call the `plot` method assigning the returned values to `line_plot_objects`. Each x-value is paired with its respective y-value. The points are connected with straight lines forming the image below."
