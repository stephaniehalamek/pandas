The mean, median, variance, minimum, maximum, and various quantiles are all examples of statistics that describe how data is distributed. Often times, the best way to understand how data is distributed is through a visualization. In this chapter, we will visualize distributions of numeric columns of data with matplotlib. Let's begin by reading in a few of the columns of the housing dataset that all have units of square feet."

    "A histogram is one of the most common methods to visualize the distribution of a single column of numeric data. A histogram is constructed by first binning the numeric data into some number of bins and then counting the values that fall within each bin. Each bin is then plotted as a rectangular bar with width stretching from the left to right edge of the bin and the height equal to the count. Before we create a histogram with matplotlib, let's create the necessary summary statistics with pandas. \n",

The bin widths are determined by finding the range of the distribution (maximum minus minimum) and dividing by the number of bins. The `precision` parameter controls the number of decimal places to use for the bins and is set to 0 to return integers. By default, bins include values that equal their right edge exactly and exclude them if they equal their left edge. We set `right` to `False` to reverse this so that it matches how matplotlib does its bin calculations."
