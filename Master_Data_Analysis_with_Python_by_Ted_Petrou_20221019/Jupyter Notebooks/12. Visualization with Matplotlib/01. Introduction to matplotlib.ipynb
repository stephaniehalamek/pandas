    "# Introduction to matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python that can produce a wide variety of plots. It is often used in scientific publications and helped create one of the first ever images of a black hole (below) in April, 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have seen a few times in this book, pandas can create plots, so you might be wondering why we need to learn about a completely separate library. All of the default plots created with pandas are done internally with matplotlib. Whenever you create a plot with pandas, a matplotlib plotting object is returned. pandas can only create a fraction of the plots available to matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major benefit of using pandas for visualization is that the plots are easier to create. The trade-off is that you won't have as much control as you do with matplotlib directly. We will eventually cover the pandas (and the seaborn) library for visualization in great deatail, but will begin with matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "![0]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two interfaces of matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "matplotlib was originally created by the late John Hunter in the early 2000's to mimic the plotting functionality of [Matlab][1], a popular scientific computing software application. In essence, it is a \"matlab-like plotting library\". One issue with porting a library from one language to another is that the idioms and practices that each language have are not often compatible. Python is usually programmed differently than matlab. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of matplotlib's development, two separate ways to interface with matplotlib evolved. They are the **state-machine environment** and the **object-oriented** approach. The state-machine environment (known as **pyplot** from here on out) implicitly handles some of the plotting for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **object-oriented** approach gives you full control over each element of the plot and fits the style of how Python is usually developed. Most plots can be reproduced with either interface, but the object-oriented approach is explicit, and in my opinion, easier to determine what is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using only the object-oriented approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The chapters on matplotlib only use the object-oriented approach, as attempting to learn both at the start is not necessary and confusing. Many tutorials online use pyplot, so it is something that you might need to understand. Thankfully, much of the code between each approach looks quite similar when making a single plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Figure - Axes hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an important hierarchy that must be understood when working with matplotlib. The highest and outermost part of a plot is the **figure**, which contains all of the other plotting elements. Typically, you do not interact with it much. Inside the figure are the **axes**. This is the actual plotting surface that you normally would refer to as a 'plot'. \n",
    "\n",
    "![2]\n",
    "\n",
    "A figure may contain any number of axes. An axes is a container for most of the plotting elements that get drawn onto your screen. This includes the x and y axis, lines, text, points, legends, images, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Axes is a confusing word\n",
    "\n",
    "The term **axes** is not actually plural and does not mean more than one axis. It literally stands for a single 'plot'. It's unfortunate that this fundamental element has a name that is so confusing. I usually pronounce it \"axeez\" when I am teaching to help differentiate it from the word 'axis'.\n",

    "### Importing the pyplot module\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing matplotlib into your workspace is done a little differently than numpy or pandas. You rarely will import matplotlib itself directly like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is perfectly valid code, but the matplotlib developers decided not to put all the main functionality in the top level module. When you `import pandas as pd`, you get access to nearly all of the available functions and classes of the pandas library. This isn't true with matplotlib. Instead, much of the functionality for quickly plotting is found in the `pyplot` module. This is the module that we want to import into our workspace. There are dozens of other modules in the matplotlib library, some of which will be imported when needed. Let's import the pyplot module now and alias it as `plt`, which is done by convention."
