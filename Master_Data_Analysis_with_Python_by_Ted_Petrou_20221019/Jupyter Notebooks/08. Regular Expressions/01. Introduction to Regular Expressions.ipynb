    "# Introduction to Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regular expressions** give us a way to search strings for specific patterns. A regular expression, or simply **regex**, is a special string that describes a specific pattern that you would like to match in another string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of questions that regexes can answer\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be helpful to see a list of questions that a regex pattern can match:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Match all words that begin with 'S' and end in 'y'\n",
    "* Match the word 'friend' or 'freind'\n",
    "* Match a word with at least 3 digits in it\n",
    "* Match all Gmail email addresses\n",
    "* Capture the word immediately following the word 'Author'\n",
    "* Capture the word immediately following the third occurrence of the word 'coffee'\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regular expressions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Many programming languages provide the capability to use regular expressions and Python is no exception. The [re module][1] is part of the Python standard library and gives Python programmers all the necessary tools to use regular expressions. The official documentation has a good tutorial for beginners on [how to use regular expressions in Python][2] that I recommend reading through in addition to this text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mini-Programming Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are a miniature programming language that have their own strict set of rules just like any other language. Regular expression syntax is written as a string mixing **literal** and **special** characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Literal vs Special Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two distinct categories of characters within a regex string - **Literal** and **Special**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Literal** - these characters don't have any special meaning. They simply represent themselves. They are also referred to as **regular** characters.\n",
    "* **Special** - these characters do have a special meaning and do not represent themselves literally. It is these special characters that provide the power in regular expressions. They are also referred to as **metacharacters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different flavors of regex\n",
    "\n",
    "Different programming languages (Python, Perl, Java, etc...) have their own \"flavor\" of regex syntax. The vast majority of regex syntax between programming languages overlap, but there are some differences. You might not be able to copy and paste a regex solution you find on Stack Overflow into your Python program if it comes from another language. This text only covers regex for the Python programming language.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Regular expressions in pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "While learning how to use the `re` module is a valuable addition to your toolset, it is not necessary in order to use regular expressions in pandas. The **regex pattern** is what is key and the focus of these chapters. You will learn the fundamentals of how to create regex patterns to match particular parts of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matching patterns in pandas string Series\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are using pandas, we will be matching patterns within Series containing strings (those with data type object or string). There are several methods that accept regex pattern strings as input with the `contains` and `extract` method being common.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `contains` and `extract` string Series methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of our work in this part of the  book will be with the `contains` and `extract` string Series methods available from the `str` accessor. The `contains` method accepts a regex pattern and returns a boolean for each value informing us whether or not the string matched the given pattern. The resulting boolean Series can be used to filter the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `extract` method also accepts a regex pattern, but allows us to extract any number of matched patterns from each value in the Series. For instance, we may want to extract the domain name from each email address.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Movie titles\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started with regexes by reading in the movie dataset and selecting the `'title'` column. We'll use it to match a variety of different patterns.\n",
