    "# Selecting Subsets of Data from DataFrames with Just the Brackets\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common tasks during a data analysis involves selecting a subset of the dataset. In pandas, this means selecting particular rows and/or columns from a DataFrame or selecting values from a Series. Although subset selection sounds like an easy task, and is an easy task for many other data manipulation tools, it's actually quite complex with pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of selections of subsets of data\n",
    "\n",
    "The following images show different types of subset selection that are possible. The DataFrame on the left is the original with the selection highlighted. The DataFrame on the right is the result of the selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selecting columns\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common subset selection involves selecting one or more columns of a DataFrame. In this example, we select the `color`, `age`, and `height` columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "![2]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selecting rows\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsets of rows are a less frequent selection. In this example, we select the rows labeled `Aaron` and `Dean`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![3]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simultaneous row and column selection\n",
    "\n",
    "The last type of subset selection involves selecting rows and columns simultaneously. In this example, we select the rows labeled `Aaron` and `Dean` along with the columns `color`, `age`, and `height`.\n",

    "## pandas dual references - by label and by integer location\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned, the index of each DataFrame provides a label to reference each individual row. Similarly, the column names provide a label to reference each column. What hasn't been mentioned, is that each row and column may be referenced by an integer as well. I call this **integer location**. The integer location begins at 0 for the first row and continues sequentially one integer at a time until the last row. The last row will have integer location `n - 1`, where `n` is the total number of rows in the DataFrame. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look above at our DataFrame one more time. The rows with labels `Aaron` and `Dean` can also be referenced by their respective integer locations 2 and 4. Similarly, the columns `color`, `age`, and `height` can be referenced by their integer locations 1, 3, and 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "The official pandas documentation refers to integer location as **position**. I don't particularly like this terminology as it's not as explicit as integer location. The key term here is the word **integer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's the difference between indexing and selecting subsets of data?\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation uses the term **indexing** frequently. This term is a shorter, more technical term that refers to **subset selection**. I prefer the term subset selection, as, again, it is more descriptive of what is actually happening. Indexing is also the term used in the official Python documentation (for selecting subsets of lists or strings for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The three indexers `[ ]`, `loc`, `iloc`\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas provides three **indexers** to select subsets of data. An indexer is a term for one of  `[ ]`, `loc`, or `iloc` and is what makes the subset selection. All the details on how to make selections with each of these indexers will be covered. Each indexer has different rules for how they work. All of our selections will look similar to the following, except they will have something placed within the brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> df[]\n",
    ">>> df.loc[]\n",
    ">>> df.iloc[]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "When the brackets are placed directly after the DataFrame variable name, the term **just the brackets** will be used to differentiate them from the brackets after `loc` and `iloc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Square brackets instead of parentheses\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common mistakes when using `loc` and `iloc` is to append parentheses to them, instead of square brackets. One of the main reasons this mistake is done is because `loc` and `iloc` appear to be methods and all methods are called with parentheses. Both `loc` and `iloc` are NOT methods, but are accessed in the same manner as methods through dot notation, which leads to the mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Few objects accessed through dot notation use brackets instead of parentheses. In Python, the brackets are a universal operator for selecting subsets of data regardless of the type of object. The brackets select subsets of lists, strings, and select a single value in a dictionary. numpy arrays use the brackets operator for subset selection. If you are doing subset selection, it's likely that you need brackets and not parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Begin with *just the brackets*\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in a previous chapter, just the brackets are used to select a single column as a Series. We place the column name inside the brackets to return the Series. Let's read in a simple, small DataFrame and select a single column from it. We use the `index_col` parameter to set the index to the first column (integer location 0) on read."
