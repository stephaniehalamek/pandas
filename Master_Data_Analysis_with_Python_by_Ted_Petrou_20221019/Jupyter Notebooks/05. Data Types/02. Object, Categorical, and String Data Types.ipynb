The string data type is new to pandas and still undergoing changes. The categorical data type has yet to be discussed, but is a fantastic way to save memory and significantly increase performance for operations done on columns containing strings.\n",

    "## Object data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Until the release of pandas 1.0, pandas did not have a string-only data type. Instead, it used the 'object' data type to hold strings. As mentioned previously, the object data type has no limitation as to what Python object can be within it. It is essentially a catch-all for any item that you desire to be in a DataFrame that doesn't belong to the other specific data types.\n",

    "Series with the object data type do not have analogous size representation like integer and float data types do. There is no `'object64'`, only a single 'object' data type. Each item can be of a different type and therefore of a different size.\n",
