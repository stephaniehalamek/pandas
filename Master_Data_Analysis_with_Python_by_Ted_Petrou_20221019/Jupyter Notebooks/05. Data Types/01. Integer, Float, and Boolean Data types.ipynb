It makes sense that bit sizes of 16, 32, or 64 don't exist for boolean data types as there are only two possible values, `True` and `False`. You may be curious as to why booleans are not represented with a single bit. This is because a byte (8 bits) is the smallest addressable unit of memory available to modern computers. Let's create a boolean Series using the constructor."
